# Hi there, I'm Sarvesh Venkittu ðŸ‘‹

## Here is a brief introduction about myself.

I am an experienced Mechanical Engineering student with a passion for the applications of AI and ML. Currently pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Philosophy at Duke University.

During the summer of 2022, I demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis as an Electrical Certifications Engineer, where I successfully developed a reproducible automated method to provide total LRU quantity per ship-set. This accomplishment showcased my strong analytical skills and attention to detail.

I am currently working towards the completion of a comprehensive course on AI, expanding my knowledge in Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and LLM as well as gaining practical experience working with popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Open-CV, scikit-learn, and NLTK.

I am driven to leverage my technical background and passion for AI to extract meaningful insights from data and contribute to the development of intelligent systems. With a solid foundation in engineering and a strong focus on AI, I am equipped to bring valuable perspectives to complex data-driven challenges.

Open to new opportunities and eager to contribute. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to drive innovation and create impactful solutions.
